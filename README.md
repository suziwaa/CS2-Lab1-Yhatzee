Hello Professor(and others)! Welcome to my Yhatzee game!
The game is single player and features 3 scoring rounds, final score will be displayed at the end after all rounds have been completed.
Files are split between a class for the Die behavior, the games UI, and general game logic.

Insanely HUGE HUGE thanks to my old senior from UofA for helping me out on this! This one was challenging and I couldn't have done it without his tips!
